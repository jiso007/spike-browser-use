# CURRENT_PROJECT_TASK.md: Recommended Next Task for /browser_use_ext

This document outlines the single most important next task for the `/browser_use_ext` project, based on analysis of `PROJECT_DOCS/CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md` and `PROJECT_DOCS/CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE.md`.

**Recommended Next Task and Its Contribution to Overall Project Goals**

*   **I. Selected Next Task:**
    *   **A. Description of the Task:**
        *   **Implement WSS (Secure WebSocket) for Production Deployments.**
        *   This task involves modifying the WebSocket server setup in the Python backend to use the WSS protocol instead of WS. This includes configuring SSL/TLS certificates and ensuring the server correctly handles secure connections. Concurrently, the Chrome extension\'s client-side WebSocket connection logic will need to be updated to connect to the `wss://` endpoint.
        *   **Primary Affected Components:**
            *   Python Backend: `browser_use_ext/extension_interface/service.py` (specifically the `ExtensionInterface` class and its server startup routines).
            *   Chrome Extension: `browser_use_ext/extension/background.js` (specifically the WebSocket connection URL and potentially related error handling for secure connection failures).
    *   **B. Justification for Selection (Importance and Impact):**
        *   **Explicit Priority and Criticality:** This task, "Implement WSS (Secure WebSocket) for production deployments," is listed as **Action Item 1** with **PRIORITY: High** under "Phase 1: Initialization & Setup" in `PROJECT_DOCS/CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE.md`. Furthermore, "Production Security Hardening" is listed as one of the "Top 3 Critical Next Steps for 100% Completion" in the overall summary of the same document.
        *   **Foundation Building / Gap Filling:** Implementing WSS is a fundamental requirement for any production deployment involving sensitive data transmission over the internet. Operating with unencrypted WebSockets (WS) is a major security vulnerability and a critical gap for a system that is otherwise 95% complete and aiming for production readiness. Secure communication is a non-negotiable baseline.
        *   **Unblocking Other Work:** While not directly blocking other *feature* development, the lack of WSS blocks any realistic production deployment or widespread user testing where data privacy and security are concerns. It\'s a prerequisite for moving towards a truly production-ready state.
        *   **Feasibility and Impact:** This task has a very high impact by addressing a critical security and production-readiness requirement. It is a well-understood technical change (implementing SSL/TLS for a WebSocket server) and is feasible to implement and test.
    *   **C. Approach to Isolated Testability:**
        *   **Backend (Python WebSocket Server):**
            *   Unit tests can mock the SSL context and certificate loading to ensure the server attempts to start in WSS mode.
            *   Integration tests can be run locally with self-signed certificates. A simple WebSocket client (Python-based or a browser-based tool) can attempt to connect to the `wss://` endpoint. Logs should confirm successful secure connection establishment or provide clear errors for SSL handshake failures.
        *   **Frontend (Chrome Extension):**
            *   Modify `background.js` to point to `wss://localhost:port` (using a self-signed cert for the local server).
            *   Load the extension in Chrome.
            *   Observe browser console logs in the extension\'s background page for successful WSS connection or specific SSL/TLS errors if the connection fails.
            *   Verify that messages can still be sent and received over the WSS connection once established.
        *   **Combined:** A simple end-to-end test where the extension connects to the local WSS-enabled backend, sends a message (e.g., "ping"), and receives a reply ("pong") would confirm the secure channel is operational. Network inspection tools (browser developer tools network tab) can also be used to verify that the connection is indeed WSS.

*   **II. Contribution to Overall Project Goal/Feature:**
    *   **A. Broader Goal/Feature from `PROJECT_DOCS/CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md` Addressed:**
        *   This task directly contributes to the overall modernization goal of creating a robust and production-ready `/browser_use_ext` system. Specifically, it addresses the **Consideration** noted in "Phase 1: Initialization & Setup" of `PROJECT_DOCS/CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md`: "_Security implications of the extension-backend communication channel._"
        *   It also aligns with the overarching, though not explicitly stated, goal of any system intended for real-world use: **ensuring secure and reliable operation.**
    *   **B. Explanation of Contribution:**
        *   Successfully implementing WSS transitions the communication channel from an insecure one (suitable only for local development) to a secure, encrypted channel. This is a critical step towards production readiness. It protects user data, task instructions, and browser state information transmitted between the Chrome extension and the backend from eavesdropping and tampering. Without WSS, the system cannot be safely deployed or used in environments where network traffic might be intercepted. This task directly hardens a core component of the system architecture – the communication layer – making the entire `/browser_use_ext` system more trustworthy and viable for real-world application.
