# Viewing Raw Browser State Before Message Transformation

The state printed previously (`agent.state.message_manager_state`) reflects the *processed* state after it has been added to the message history managed by `MessageManager`. This includes system prompts, task descriptions, and formatted browser state information.

## The Transformation Point

The raw `BrowserState` object (containing the URL, simplified DOM tree, selector map, etc.) is transformed into LLM-readable messages within the `MessageManager.add_state_message` method.

## How to View the Raw `BrowserState`

To see the raw `BrowserState` data *before* it undergoes transformation by `MessageManager.add_state_message`, you need to intercept it within the `Agent.step` method immediately after it's retrieved.

1.  **File:** `browser_use/agent/service.py`
2.  **Method:** `async def step(self, ...)`
3.  **Location:** Insert a print statement *after* the `BrowserState` object is assigned to the `state` variable and *before* it's passed to `self._message_manager.add_state_message(...)`.

**Code Snippet (Illustrative Location approx. Lines 391-417):**

```python
# browser_use/agent/service.py

# ... inside Agent.step method ...
		try:
			# <<<--- 1. Raw state is retrieved here --->>>
			state = await self.browser_context.get_state(cache_clickable_elements_hashes=True)
			active_page = await self.browser_context.get_current_page()

			# <<<--- !!! INSERT PRINT STATEMENT HERE to see raw state !!! --->>>
			# Example:
			print(">>> RAW BrowserState Object <<<")
			# Use model_dump_json for a readable Pydantic model output
			print(state.model_dump_json(indent=2))
			print("---------------------------------")

			# ... (memory, pause check, action model updates) ...

			# <<<--- 2. Raw state is processed and added to messages here --->>>
			self._message_manager.add_state_message(state, self.state.last_result, step_info, self.settings.use_vision)

            # ... (rest of the step method) ...
```

By printing `state.model_dump_json(indent=2)` at this location, you will see the complete, raw structure of the `BrowserState` object as retrieved from the browser context, before it's formatted for the LLM conversation history.
