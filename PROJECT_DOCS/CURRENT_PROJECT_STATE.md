# CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE.md: Analysis and Action Plan

This document analyzes the current state of the `/browser_use_ext` project against the goals outlined in `PROJECT_DOCS/CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md`. It identifies completed work, gaps, and specific action items required for full integration and functionality.

## Overall Project Status Summary (October 26, 2023)

*   **Overall Completeness:** Approximately 60-70% towards the goals outlined in `CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md`. Core communication (WebSocket), state representation, and action execution mechanisms are in place but require further refinement, hardening, and comprehensive testing.
*   **Major Roadblocks:**
    1.  Ensuring consistent and reliable state synchronization, especially handling dynamic content and SPA (Single Page Application) behaviors.
    2.  Robust error handling and recovery across the Python backend and Chrome extension.
    3.  Defining and implementing a comprehensive set of "actionable element" identification heuristics in `content.js`.
*   **Top 3 Critical Next Steps (Overall Project):**
    1.  **Refine State Synchronization:** Implement robust event-driven and on-demand state updates, including handling of partial updates or diffs if deemed necessary for performance (Phase 5 & Integration Point 5).
    2.  **Implement Comprehensive Action & Error Handling:** Finalize the full suite of actions in `content.js`, ensure all actions correctly report success/failure, and propagate detailed errors to the agent (Phase 4, 5 & Integration Point 4). Test the two-way "ready" handshake thoroughly ([chrome_extension_content_readiness.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/chrome_extension_content_readiness.mdc)).
    3.  **Enhance Agent Adaptation:** Adapt the agent's logic in `browser_use_ext/agent/agent_core.py` to effectively use the new "simplified state representation" and make decisions based on extension-provided `available_operations` (Phase 3).

*   **Unclear or Assumed Points:**
    *   The precise heuristics for "significant DOM mutations" that trigger unsolicited state updates from the extension need further definition and testing.
    *   The extent to which the agent (`browser_use_ext/agent/agent_core.py`) needs to be modified to understand the `available_operations` field in the state is still being evaluated. Initial prompting seems to work, but deeper integration might be needed.
    *   Scalability of the current WebSocket connection management in `browser_use_ext/extension_interface/service.py` for many concurrent users/tabs (though not an immediate MVP concern).

## Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Initialization & Setup

*   **Goal for this Phase (from `PROJECT_DOCS/CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md`):** Main application/backend initializes the agent and WebSocket server. Chrome extension connects, registers, and signals readiness. No backend browser launch.

*   **Current State Analysis:**
    *   **What is currently happening (that misses the goal):**
        *   While the WebSocket server (`browser_use_ext/extension_interface/service.py`) starts and the extension (`browser_use_ext/extension/background.js`) attempts to connect, the "readiness" signal and robust registration are still basic.
        *   Error handling for initial connection failures or multiple extension instances from the same user is not fully developed.
        *   The two-way "ready" handshake as per [chrome_extension_content_readiness.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/chrome_extension_content_readiness.mdc) is partially implemented but needs verification for all edge cases (e.g., extension reload, background script crash).
    *   **What is currently happening (that moves towards/accomplishes the goal):**
        *   The `ExtensionInterface` service in `browser_use_ext/extension_interface/service.py` successfully starts a WebSocket server.
        *   `browser_use_ext/extension/background.js` establishes a WebSocket connection upon startup.
        *   Basic message passing for registration (e.g., sending a client ID) is implemented.
        *   The `content_script_ready` message is sent by `content.js` and handled by `background.js`, and `contentScriptsReady` Set is used. (Ref: [chrome_extension_content_readiness.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/chrome_extension_content_readiness.mdc))
        *   The `waitForContentScriptReady` function exists in `background.js`.
    *   **What needs to happen (that will move towards/accomplish the goal):**
        *   **Action Item 1:** Fully implement and test the two-way "ready" handshake.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/extension/background.js`, `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js`, `browser_use_ext/extension_interface/service.py`.
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** WebSocket messages: `{type: "content_script_ready"}`, `{type: "background_ready_ack"}`. Python Pydantic models in `browser_use_ext/extension_interface/models.py` for connection tracking.
            *   **"Done":** `background.js` reliably waits for `content_script_ready` before sending messages to content script. Backend reliably knows when a specific tab is ready for interaction. `test_content_script_ready.py` passes for all scenarios.
            *   **Relevant Rules/Guidelines:** [chrome_extension_content_readiness.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/chrome_extension_content_readiness.mdc), [python_websockets_guidelines.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/python_websockets_guidelines.mdc).
        *   **Action Item 2:** Enhance backend registration of extension instances.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/extension_interface/service.py`.
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** `ConnectionInfo` model in `browser_use_ext/extension_interface/models.py` might need to store more metadata about the extension instance (e.g., version, user ID if applicable).
            *   **"Done":** Backend can uniquely identify and manage multiple connected extension instances or tabs.
            *   **Prioritization:** Medium.
        *   **Action Item 3:** Implement robust error handling for WebSocket connection lifecycle.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/extension/background.js`, `browser_use_ext/extension_interface/service.py`.
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** Standard WebSocket error codes and connection events.
            *   **"Done":** Extension attempts to reconnect on dropped connections. Backend gracefully handles disconnects and cleans up resources.
            *   **Prioritization:** High.

### Phase 2: Task Reception

*   **Goal for this Phase (from `PROJECT_DOCS/CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md`):** User inputs task in extension UI. Extension sends task and context to backend. Backend routes to agent.

*   **Current State Analysis:**
    *   **What is currently happening (that misses the goal):**
        *   The extension UI (`browser_use_ext/extension/popup.html`, `popup.js`) is very basic and primarily for initiating connection/sending test messages. It does not have a dedicated task input field.
        *   The bundling of contextual information (URL, title, selected text) with the task is not yet implemented in `popup.js` or `background.js`.
        *   The backend `ExtensionInterface` (`browser_use_ext/extension_interface/service.py`) can receive generic messages but doesn't have a specifically typed handler for "user_task_submission" that includes rich context.
    *   **What is currently happening (that moves towards/accomplishes the goal):**
        *   `browser_use_ext/extension/popup.js` can send messages to `background.js`.
        *   `browser_use_ext/extension/background.js` can forward messages to the Python backend via WebSocket.
        *   The Python backend (`browser_use_ext/extension_interface/service.py`) can receive these messages.
        *   The `AgentCore` in `browser_use_ext/agent/agent_core.py` is designed to receive tasks, though currently expects them via its direct methods rather than from the extension interface.
    *   **What needs to happen (that will move towards/accomplish the goal):**
        *   **Action Item 1:** Develop the extension UI for task input.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/extension/popup.html`, `browser_use_ext/extension/popup.js`.
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** HTML form elements for input. JavaScript to capture input.
            *   **"Done":** User can type a task into the extension popup, and it's captured by `popup.js`.
            *   **Prioritization:** High.
        *   **Action Item 2:** Implement contextual information bundling in the extension.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/extension/popup.js` (to initiate context gathering), `browser_use_ext/extension/background.js` (to access tab information like URL, title). Potentially `content.js` if DOM-specific context like selected text is needed.
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** JSON payload as described in `CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md` (e.g., `{type: "user_task_submission", user_prompt: "...", context: {url: "...", ...}}`).
            *   **"Done":** When a task is submitted, `popup.js` and `background.js` gather current URL, title, and selected text, and send it with the prompt.
            *   **Prioritization:** High.
        *   **Action Item 3:** Create a dedicated backend handler for `user_task_submission`.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/extension_interface/service.py`, `browser_use_ext/extension_interface/models.py`.
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** New Pydantic model in `models.py` for `UserTaskSubmission` (prompt + context object). Handler function in `service.py` to validate this model and pass to the agent.
            *   **"Done":** Backend receives the `user_task_submission` message, validates it, and successfully routes the prompt and context to `AgentCore`.
            *   **Relevant Rules/Guidelines:** [pydantic_model_guidelines.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/pydantic_model_guidelines.mdc).

### Phase 3: Action Generation (by the Agent/LLM)

*   **Goal for this Phase (from `PROJECT_DOCS/CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md`):** Agent receives task and simplified state from extension. Agent analyzes and formulates an action command for the extension.

*   **Current State Analysis:**
    *   **What is currently happening (that misses the goal):**
        *   The `AgentCore` (`browser_use_ext/agent/agent_core.py`) primarily uses a `BrowserContext` object which is a remnant of the Playwright-based system. It doesn't yet fully utilize the "simplified state representation" that would come from `content.js`.
        *   The `prompts.py` file may need adjustments to instruct the LLM on how to use the new simplified state (especially the `actionable_elements` array and `available_operations`).
        *   The output of the agent is still geared towards an `ActionModel` that was used with the old `Controller`, not a JSON command tailored for `content.js`.
    *   **What is currently happening (that moves towards/accomplishes the goal):**
        *   `AgentCore` (`browser_use_ext/agent/agent_core.py`) exists and has the core LLM interaction logic.
        *   `BrowserContext` in `browser_use_ext/browser/context.py` has been modified to include `get_state()` which *can* be called by the agent and *does* fetch state from the extension.
        *   The concept of `actionable_elements` is defined in `browser_use_ext/dom/views.py` (`ActionableElement`) and used by `browser_use_ext/browser/views.py` (`BrowserState`), which `content.js` attempts to populate and send.
        *   The extension (`browser_use_ext/extension/content.js`) gathers and sends a "simplified state representation" (though its completeness and accuracy are still under review).
    *   **What needs to happen (that will move towards/accomplish the goal):**
        *   **Action Item 1:** Adapt `AgentCore` to primarily use the extension-provided state.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/agent/agent_core.py`, `browser_use_ext/browser/context.py`.
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** The `BrowserState` Pydantic model (from `browser_use_ext/browser/views.py`) which mirrors the JSON structure from `content.js`.
            *   **"Done":** `AgentCore.determine_next_action()` consistently uses the state obtained via `BrowserContext.get_state()` (which comes from the extension) as its primary source of truth for the web page's condition.
            *   **Prioritization:** High.
        *   **Action Item 2:** Refine LLM prompts for new state representation.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/agent/prompts.py`.
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** Text prompts for the LLM. The prompts must guide the LLM to understand the `actionable_elements` list, their `id`s, and `available_operations`.
            *   **"Done":** LLM responses demonstrate an understanding of the new state format and correctly choose valid `available_operations` for given element IDs.
            *   **Prioritization:** Medium. Test with `test_agent_prompts.py`.
        *   **Action Item 3:** Modify agent output to be extension-compatible action commands.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/agent/agent_core.py`, `browser_use_ext/agent/views.py` (if `ActionModel` is adapted or replaced).
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** Agent should output a JSON structure like `{action: "click", element_id: "ext_generated_id_123"}` or `{action: "input_text", element_id: "ext_generated_id_456", text: "hello"}`. This might mean creating a new Pydantic model for `ExtensionActionCommand` in `browser_use_ext/extension_interface/models.py`.
            *   **"Done":** Agent outputs action commands in the format expected by `background.js` / `content.js`.
            *   **Prioritization:** High.

### Phase 4: Action Execution

*   **Goal for this Phase (from `PROJECT_DOCS/CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md`):** Extension receives action command. `content.js` executes it using vanilla JS DOM manipulation.

*   **Current State Analysis:**
    *   **What is currently happening (that misses the goal):**
        *   `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js` has implementations for some actions (e.g., click, input), but not all potential actions are covered (e.g., select dropdown, scroll to element, complex hovers if needed).
        *   Robust handling of timing, element presence, and page readiness before attempting actions within `content.js` is still maturing. For example, waiting for an element to be truly "clickable" or "visible".
        *   The mapping from `element_id` (provided by the agent, originally generated by `content.js`) back to the actual DOM element needs to be flawless, especially if the DOM has changed subtly.
    *   **What is currently happening (that moves towards/accomplishes the goal):**
        *   `browser_use_ext/extension/background.js` can receive messages (action commands) from the Python backend and forward them to the correct tab's `content.js`.
        *   `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js` has a listener for messages from `background.js` and a basic dispatcher for different action types.
        *   Core actions like clicking and inputting text are partially implemented in `content.js`. Test files like `test_action_execution.js` exist.
        *   The `chrome_extension_content_readiness.mdc` rule is being followed to ensure `content.js` is ready before `background.js` sends it commands.
    *   **What needs to happen (that will move towards/accomplish the goal):**
        *   **Action Item 1:** Implement a comprehensive suite of actions in `content.js`.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js`.
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** JavaScript functions for each action type (click, input, navigate, scroll, select_option, get_attributes, read_text, read_value). Input parameters will be part of the action command from the agent (e.g., `element_id`, `text_to_input`, `url_to_navigate`).
            *   **"Done":** `content.js` can successfully execute all defined browser actions based on commands from the agent. `test_action_execution.js` covers all actions.
            *   **Prioritization:** High.
        *   **Action Item 2:** Enhance `content.js` pre-action checks (visibility, interactability).
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js`.
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** Helper functions in `content.js` to check `element.offsetParent`, `getComputedStyle`, `element.disabled`, etc.
            *   **"Done":** Actions are only attempted on elements that are verified to be in an interactable state, reducing errors.
            *   **Prioritization:** Medium.
        *   **Action Item 3:** Solidify `element_id` to DOM element resolution in `content.js`.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js`.
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** The internal mapping or re-finding logic used by `content.js` when it generates `id`s in the state representation, and then later receives an action for one of those `id`s.
            *   **"Done":** `content.js` can reliably find the target DOM element using the `element_id` from the action command, even with minor DOM changes, or correctly report if it's gone.
            *   **Prioritization:** Medium.

### Phase 5: Result Processing & State Update

*   **Goal for this Phase (from `PROJECT_DOCS/CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md`):** Extension observes action outcome, gathers updated state, and sends an action result (success/failure, data, new state) to the backend. Backend updates its state.

*   **Current State Analysis:**
    *   **What is currently happening (that misses the goal):**
        *   `content.js` sends back a basic success/failure message for some actions, but it's not consistently providing a detailed `action_result` payload including the `new_simplified_state` or structured `error_info`.
        *   The backend (`browser_use_ext/extension_interface/service.py`) has a generic message handler but needs a specific handler for `action_result` messages to parse them and update its state representation (e.g., within `BrowserContext`).
        *   The "State Synchronization Strategy" (Integration Point 5 in `CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md`) involving proactive pushes on DOM mutations or navigation events is not fully implemented in `content.js` or `background.js`.
    *   **What is currently happening (that moves towards/accomplishes the goal):**
        *   `content.js` attempts to send some form of response after an action.
        *   The mechanism for `content.js` to gather the "simplified state representation" exists (used in Phase 3).
        *   The Python backend (`ExtensionInterface`) can receive messages.
        *   `BrowserContext.update_state_from_extension()` method exists, intended for this purpose.
    *   **What needs to happen (that will move towards/accomplish the goal):**
        *   **Action Item 1:** Implement full `action_result` message sending from `content.js`.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js`.
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** JSON payload as described in `CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md` (e.g., `{type: "action_result", original_action_id: "...", status: "...", outcome_details: {}, new_simplified_state: {}, error_info: {}}`).
            *   **"Done":** After every action, `content.js` sends a complete `action_result` message, including the new state and detailed error if any.
            *   **Prioritization:** High.
        *   **Action Item 2:** Develop backend handler for `action_result` and state update.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/extension_interface/service.py`, `browser_use_ext/extension_interface/models.py`, `browser_use_ext/browser/context.py`.
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** Pydantic model in `models.py` for `ActionResultPayload`. Handler in `service.py` to parse this and call `BrowserContext.update_state_from_extension()`.
            *   **"Done":** Backend successfully receives, validates `action_result` messages, and updates `BrowserContext` with the new state or error information.
            *   **Prioritization:** High.
            *   **Relevant Rules/Guidelines:** [pydantic_model_guidelines.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/pydantic_model_guidelines.mdc).
        *   **Action Item 3:** Implement proactive state updates from extension (on navigation, significant DOM changes).
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js` (using `MutationObserver`), `browser_use_ext/extension/background.js` (for `chrome.tabs.onUpdated`).
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** WebSocket message like `{type: "unsolicited_state_update", new_simplified_state: {}}`.
            *   **"Done":** Extension sends state updates to the backend when significant page changes occur without direct agent action.
            *   **Prioritization:** Medium-Low (post-MVP enhancement).

### Phase 6: Iterative Loop or Termination

*   **Goal for this Phase (from `PROJECT_DOCS/CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md`):** Agent receives action result. If task not done, uses result and new state for next action. Cycle repeats.

*   **Current State Analysis:**
    *   **What is currently happening (that misses the goal):**
        *   The main loop in `AgentCore` (`browser_use_ext/agent/agent_core.py`) is not yet fully driven by the asynchronous `action_result` messages coming from the extension. It's more synchronous based on its internal calls.
        *   Criteria for "task completion" based on extension signals or agent interpretation are not clearly defined or implemented.
        *   Error handling logic within the agent (e.g., retries, alternative actions based on extension-reported errors) is basic.
    *   **What is currently happening (that moves towards/accomplishes the goal):**
        *   `AgentCore` has a conceptual loop for processing tasks.
        *   The `BrowserContext.get_state()` and `update_state_from_extension()` methods provide the mechanisms for the agent to get new state.
    *   **What needs to happen (that will move towards/accomplish the goal):**
        *   **Action Item 1:** Refactor `AgentCore` for asynchronous, message-driven iteration.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/agent/agent_core.py`, `browser_use_ext/extension_interface/service.py` (to signal agent).
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** Agent needs to wait for an `action_result` (passed from `ExtensionInterface`) before deciding on the next step. This might involve `asyncio` events or callbacks.
            *   **"Done":** The agent's decision cycle is correctly triggered by `action_result` messages received from the extension.
            *   **Prioritization:** High.
        *   **Action Item 2:** Define and implement task completion criteria.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/agent/agent_core.py`, `browser_use_ext/agent/prompts.py` (LLM might determine completion).
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** Potentially a new field in `action_result` or a specific message from the extension (`{type: "task_suggest_completion"}`). The agent's internal logic/LLM prompt for deciding `is_done`.
            *   **"Done":** Agent can reliably determine when a multi-step task is complete based on results and state.
            *   **Prioritization:** Medium.
        *   **Action Item 3:** Implement robust error handling and retry logic in `AgentCore`.
            *   **Affected Components:** `browser_use_ext/agent/agent_core.py`.
            *   **Data Structures/Interfaces:** Agent needs to process the `error_info` from `action_result` and decide on strategies like retrying the action, trying an alternative, or stopping.
            *   **"Done":** Agent demonstrates intelligent responses to common errors reported by the extension (e.g., element not found, action failed).
            *   **Prioritization:** Medium.

## Key Integration Points - Current State and Actions

### 1. State Representation and Actionable Item Identification
*   **Goal:** Extension provides rich, simplified JSON state. Backend agent uses this.
*   **Current State:**
    *   **Happening (Towards Goal):** `content.js` generates a JSON state with `url`, `title`, `actionable_elements`. `actionable_elements` includes `id`, `type`, `tag`, `text_content`, `attributes`, `is_visible`, and `available_operations`. Pydantic models (`BrowserState`, `ActionableElement` in `browser_use_ext/browser/views.py` and `browser_use_ext/dom/views.py`) exist for this on the Python side.
    *   **Missing Goal:** `available_operations` might not be fully accurate or comprehensive for all element types. The stability and uniqueness of extension-generated `id`s need more rigorous testing. Criteria for "significant" items in `content.js` are heuristic and could be improved.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   **Action Item 1.1:** Refine `available_operations` logic in `content.js`.
        *   **Affected:** `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js` (specifically `getElementAvailableOperations` or similar).
        *   **"Done":** `available_operations` accurately reflects what the extension can do for each listed element.
        *   **Prioritize:** Medium. (Covered by Phase 3 & 4 actions)
    *   **Action Item 1.2:** Improve and test "actionable/significant" item identification in `content.js`.
        *   **Affected:** `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js` (logic for selecting elements to include in state).
        *   **"Done":** State representation is consistently useful and not overly verbose or missing critical elements. Tested with `test_actionable_elements.js`.
        *   **Prioritize:** Medium.

### 2. Handling Asynchronous Operations and Environment Readiness
*   **Goal:** Extension reliably handles async DOM operations, determines readiness, and communicates this.
*   **Current State:**
    *   **Happening (Towards Goal):** `content.js` uses `async/await`. Some polling/timeout logic for specific actions. `MutationObserver` is used in some places.
    *   **Missing Goal:** Comprehensive strategy for all actions to wait for appropriate readiness (e.g., after click causing AJAX). Communication of "operation complete and environment ready" via `action_result` payload (as detailed in Phase 5) is not fully implemented.
*   **Action Items:** (Largely covered by Phase 4 and 5 actions)
    *   **Action Item 2.1:** Standardize async handling and readiness checks in `content.js` for all actions.
        *   **Affected:** `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js`.
        *   **"Done":** All actions reliably wait for completion and page stability before sending `action_result`.
        *   **Prioritize:** High.

### 3. User Input Contextual Information
*   **Goal:** Extension bundles URL, title, selected text with user prompt.
*   **Current State:**
    *   **Missing Goal:** Not implemented. `popup.js` only sends the raw prompt.
*   **Action Items:** (Covered by Phase 2, Action Item 2)

### 4. Error Handling Protocol and Propagation
*   **Goal:** Extension sends structured errors; backend agent processes them.
*   **Current State:**
    *   **Happening (Towards Goal):** Basic error catching in `content.js`.
    *   **Missing Goal:** Sending fully structured `error_info` objects (as per `CURRENT_PROJECT_GOAL.md` spec) is inconsistent. Agent error processing is basic.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   **Action Item 4.1:** Implement standardized structured error reporting from `content.js`.
        *   **Affected:** `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js`.
        *   **Data Structures:** `error_info` object with `error_code`, `message`, `details`, `component_origin`.
        *   **"Done":** All foreseeable errors in `content.js` are caught and reported in the standard structure within the `action_result` message.
        *   **Prioritize:** High. (Part of Phase 5, Action Item 1)
    *   **Action Item 4.2:** Enhance agent's ability to understand and act on these structured errors.
        *   **Affected:** `browser_use_ext/agent/agent_core.py`.
        *   **"Done":** Agent uses `error_info` to make better retry/alternative decisions.
        *   **Prioritize:** Medium. (Part of Phase 6, Action Item 3)

### 5. State Synchronization Strategy
*   **Goal:** Hybrid event-driven (extension push) and on-demand (backend pull) state sync.
*   **Current State:**
    *   **Happening (Towards Goal):** Extension sends state after *some* actions. Backend (`BrowserContext`) has `get_state()` for on-demand pull and `update_state_from_extension()`.
    *   **Missing Goal:** Proactive push on significant DOM mutations or navigation events not directly tied to an agent action is not implemented. Full vs. Partial update strategy is not deeply explored (currently sends full relevant state).
*   **Action Items:**
    *   **Action Item 5.1:** Implement proactive state updates from extension (DOM mutations, navigation).
        *   **Affected:** `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js`, `browser_use_ext/extension/background.js`.
        *   **"Done":** Backend receives timely state updates triggered by page changes not directly initiated by the agent.
        *   **Prioritize:** Medium-Low. (Covered by Phase 5, Action Item 3)

### 6. Target Environment Item/Entity Identification Strategy
*   **Goal:** Extension provides stable IDs; agent uses these IDs. Robust handling of stale IDs.
*   **Current State:**
    *   **Happening (Towards Goal):** `content.js` generates `id` for `actionable_elements`. Agent is intended to use these.
    *   **Missing Goal:** Rigorous testing of ID stability and the extension's ability to re-find elements using these IDs if the DOM changes. Stale ID handling (extension reporting `TARGET_ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND` and agent reacting) needs full implementation and testing.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   **Action Item 6.1:** Test and solidify ID generation and resolution in `content.js`.
        *   **Affected:** `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js`.
        *   **"Done":** Extension-generated IDs are proven to be reasonably stable and resolvable across minor DOM changes.
        *   **Prioritize:** Medium. (Covered by Phase 4, Action Item 3)
    *   **Action Item 6.2:** Implement full stale ID handling loop (extension reports error, agent gets new state and re-evaluates).
        *   **Affected:** `browser_use_ext/extension/content.js`, `browser_use_ext/agent/agent_core.py`.
        *   **"Done":** System can recover from situations where an element ID becomes stale between state capture and action execution.
        *   **Prioritize:** Medium. (Related to Phase 4, 5, 6 error handling and iteration)
