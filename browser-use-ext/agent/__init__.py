# This file makes the agent directory a Python package. 

# You might want to expose key classes from the agent submodules here, for example:
# from .views import AgentSettings, AgentOutput
# from .message_manager.service import MessageManager
# from .memory.service import AgentMemory
# from .prompts import SystemPrompt

# For now, keeping it simple. Can be expanded as the agent develops.
