# First LLM Touchpoint for Task Execution

This document identifies the initial point in the `browser-use` execution flow (as detailed in `SPIKE_FLOW.md`) where the Large Language Model (LLM) is first contacted to process the user-provided task and determine the initial actions.

## Sequence Leading to First LLM Call:

1.  **Initialization:** The `Agent` is initialized (`Agent.__init__`), potentially including a brief LLM call for connection verification (`_verify_llm_connection` - `SPIKE_FLOW.md`, Line 26), but this call is not for task processing.
2.  **Run Agent:** `agent.run()` begins the execution loop (`SPIKE_FLOW.md`, Line 38).
3.  **First Step:** The `agent.run()` loop calls `Agent.step()` for the first time (`SPIKE_FLOW.md`, Line 46).

## The First Task-Related LLM Call:

Inside the *first execution* of `Agent.step()` (`SPIKE_FLOW.md`, starting Line 56):

*   The agent gathers the initial context: system prompt, the user's task (e.g., "Go to wikipedia.com and search for deepseek"), and the initial browser state.
*   The core interaction occurs at **Point 9: `Call LLM for Action: Agent.get_next_action() sends history/state to the LLM.` (`SPIKE_FLOW.md`, Line 69)**.
*   This `get_next_action` method is responsible for packaging the information and sending it to the configured LLM.
*   The actual API communication happens via the LangChain integration, noted in the sub-point: **`Uses LangChain's llm.invoke(...) or similar.` (`SPIKE_FLOW.md`, Line 70)**.

**In summary:** The first time the LLM is invoked to understand the specific task and decide on the *initial actions* (like navigating to a URL) is during the first call to `Agent.step()`, within the `Agent.get_next_action()` method, referenced on **Line 69** of `SPIKE_FLOW.md`.
