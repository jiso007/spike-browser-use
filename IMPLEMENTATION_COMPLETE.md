# User Input Implementation Complete âœ…

## What Was Added

### 1. Extension Popup UI (browser_use_ext/extension/popup.html)
- Added a task input section with:
  - Textarea for entering tasks
  - Submit button to execute tasks
  - Status display for feedback

### 2. Popup JavaScript (browser_use_ext/extension/popup.js)
- Added task submission handler
- Sends SUBMIT_TASK messages to background script
- Provides user feedback (success/error)
- Captures current tab context

### 3. Background Script (browser_use_ext/extension/background.js)
- Added GET_POPUP_STATUS handler for connection status
- Added SUBMIT_TASK handler to:
  - Validate WebSocket connection
  - Set active tab from context
  - Forward task to Python server as "user_task_submitted" event

### 4. Python Extension Interface (browser_use_ext/extension_interface/service.py)
- Added handler for "user_task_submitted" events
- Updates active tab ID when task is submitted
- Logs task details for agent processing

## How to Test

1. **Start the Python WebSocket server:**
   ```bash
   # Using Poetry (if available):
   poetry run python test_user_input.py
   
   # Or with virtual environment:
   python3 test_user_input.py
   ```

2. **Load the extension in Chrome:**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `browser_use_ext/extension` directory

3. **Test the functionality:**
   - Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
   - You should see:
     - Connection status (Connected/Disconnected)
     - Task input field
     - Submit button
   - Enter a task like "Find cheap laptops on Amazon"
   - Click "Execute Task"
   - Check the Python server logs for the received task

## Expected Behavior

1. **When WebSocket is connected:**
   - Status shows "Connected"
   - Submit button is enabled
   - Tasks are sent to Python server
   - Success message appears after submission

2. **When WebSocket is disconnected:**
   - Status shows "Disconnected"
   - Submit button is disabled
   - Error message if trying to submit

3. **In Python server logs:**
   ```
   User submitted task from extension popup: 'Find cheap laptops on Amazon' (Tab ID: 123)
   Task details - Task: Find cheap laptops on Amazon, Context: {...}, Tab: 123
   ```

## Integration with Agent

The Python server now receives user tasks via the `user_task_submitted` event. To integrate with your agent system:

1. In `extension_interface/service.py`, the handler logs the task
2. You can modify this handler to trigger your agent:
   ```python
   # Example integration point:
   elif event_name == "user_task_submitted":
       task = event_payload.get("task")
       # Trigger your agent here:
       # await self.agent.process_task(task, tab_id)
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Connect the received tasks to your agent processing system
2. Add task status updates back to the extension
3. Implement progress indicators in the popup
4. Add task history/results display

The user input flow is now complete from Chrome extension to Python backend! ðŸŽ‰
