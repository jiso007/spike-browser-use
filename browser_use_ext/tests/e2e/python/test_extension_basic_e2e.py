Simple E2E tests for Chrome extension functionality.

These tests demonstrate real Chrome extension + WebSocket server interaction.
They are designed to be more lightweight than the full agent tests.

# Example of how to run these tests:
# 
# 1. Start Chrome browser
# 2. Load the extension in developer mode from browser_use_ext/extension/
# 3. Ensure WS_URL in background.js points to ws://localhost:8766
# 4. Open at least one tab (e.g., example.com)
# 5. Run: poetry run pytest browser_use_ext/tests/e2e/python/test_extension_basic_e2e.py -v
#
# Note: These tests require manual browser setup but are much faster than full agent tests.
